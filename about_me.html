	<p style="color: black; font-family: playfair; font-size: 20px; text-align: center;">Hi There! My Name Is Yumni Maisara Binti Amran. On April This Year, I Will Officially Am 21 Years Old. I Live In Kelantan And I Am Also Studying In University Teknologi Malaysia In Kelantan Too. I Am On My Fifth Semester, Which Is My Last Year, In Information Management.</p>

	<p style="color: darkgreen; font-family: monospace; text-align: center; font-size: 30px; padding: 10px;"> <b><i>How To Describe Myself</i></b></p>

	<p style="text-align: justify; color: black; font-size: 20px; font-family: playfair"> Describing myself is one of the toughest tasks to do, but it's fascinating too, to put it to words. I believe our traits - be they positive or negative - make Us the person we are to the world. As a person, I believe life is an art, and I am the artist of my life. I try to keep it full of colors and as cheerful as possible no matter what life throws at me. I am an enthusiast and a person full of curiosity. Curious to know what life is all about and what it holds in the future.</p>

	<p style="color: darkgreen; font-family: monospace; text-align: center; font-size: 30px; padding: 10px"> <b><i>Dreams And Inspiraion</i></b></p>

	<p style="text-align: justify; color: black; font-size: 20px; font-family: playfair"> A dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination and hard work. The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams. All our dreams can come true, if we have the courage to pursue them. Who looks outside, dreams; who looks inside, awakes. â€œWe can not change the world in one day, but we can talk and promote values that are beneficial both for the planet and for the people who are in this industry extremely vulnerable when we talk about the inhumane working conditions of mass production of textiles on a global level. Collections must last longer.When choosing clothes you have to wonder where it comes from clothes you want to buy and who it is produced, and in what circumstances? It is important to be ethically aware and environmentally responsible.Take an interest in the story of the brand, the creation you will love for years. Buy clothing made to last, not one created that is as soon as you need to replace. Trends have become quieter because a lot of the other voices need to be strengthened."</p>
